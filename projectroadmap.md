# Roadmap document for Severity Prediction GUI Project

- [x] 1. DONE Project proposal and receive approval from instructor.  Assigned:  Jana/Nathan
- [x] 2. DONE Prepare Github repository:  Assigned:  Jana/Nathan
- [x] 3. DONE Create repository Readme.md  Assigned:  Nathan
- [x] 4. DONE Create repository projectroadmap.md  Assigned:  Nathan
- [x] 5. DONE Meet with client regarding usage of client data  Assigned:  Nathan
- [x] 6. DONE Communicate with instructor regarding maintaining confidentiality of client data  Assigned:  Jana
- [x] 7. DONE Prepare initial Keras network ("NN") for severity prediction.  Required result: Network with minimum 80% prediction accuracy  Assigned:  Nathan
- [x] 8. DONE Code initial tkinter GUI frame with input field.  Assigned:  Jana
- [x] 9. DONE Code initial tkinter GUI buttons.  Assigned:  Jana
- [x] 10.  DONE Investigate usage of NN for imputing additional data to further improve NN.  Required result:  Demonstrate usage of NN to predict missing data.  Assigned:  Nathan
- [] 11.  Code Input button to add any strings in the input field to the variable string and display current string above the submit button. Assigned:  Jana
- [] 12.  Code Submit button to run the call_model(string) function, using the current string variable as input.  The returned string is then displayed as '"Predicted Severity: ", returned_result.'  Assigned:  Jana
- [] 13.  Code call_model(string) to accept GUI input and return a phrase for test purposes.  Required result:  returned_result = 10 characters of input phrase for testing purposes.  Assigned:  Nathan
- [] 14.  Code call_model(string) to transform input data for usage in prediction.  Return size of input array.  Required result: returned_result = array size.  Assigned:  Nathan
- [] 15.  Code call_model(string) to run prediction using transformed input data and Return predicted severity.  Required result:  returned_result = integer value for predicted severity.  Assigned:  Nathan
- [] 16.  Code output display window to print '"Predicted Severity: ", str(returned result)' Assigned: Jana
- [] 17.  Prepare code to interpret integer value of severity as its text equivilant.  Assigned:  Jana
- [x] 18. Code test call_model for use in testing of UI.  Assigned: Nathan
